# Docker Flow Cron

This project is in the **design phase**.

## High Level Design

The project should be able to:

[ ] schedule jobs using cron syntax
[ ] run jobs as Swarm services
[ ] run jobs as "normal" containers
[ ] use `constraint`, `reserve-cpu`, `reserve-memory`, and `label` arguments
[ ] rerun failed jobs
[ ] send notifications when a job fails
[ ] provide dashboard with job statuses
[ ] provide UI for administration
[ ] be fault tolerant
[ ] time out
